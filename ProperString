Problem 1:- (Easy Level)
A proper string is defined as a string in which two adjacent characters cannot both be consonants, nor can they both be vowels. 
One must be a vowel, and the other must be a consonant.

The letters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' and 'u' are called vowels. And the remaining letters which are not vowels are called consonants.

Given a string 'S' consisting of 'N' lowercase English letters, your task is to return true if 'S' is a proper string; if not, then return false.

For Example :
Let's say 'N' = 3 and 'S' = "abe"

In the string, there are no two adjacent characters such that either both are consonants or both are vowels.

Hence the string is a proper string, so we return true.

Cpp Solution:-

#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
bool isProper(string &s) {
    // Write your code here.


    int n = s.size();


    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {


        bool curr = false;


        if (s[i] == 'a' or s[i] == 'e' or s[i] == 'i' 
          or s[i] == 'o' or s[i] == 'u') {
            curr = true;
        }


        
        bool prev = false;


        if (s[i - 1] == 'a' or s[i - 1] == 'e' or s[i - 1] == 'i' 
          or s[i - 1] == 'o' or s[i - 1] == 'u') {
            prev = true;
        }


        
        if (curr == prev) {
            return false;
        }
    }


    return true;
}
