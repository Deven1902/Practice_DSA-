Problem 2:- (Easy Level)
You are given an array ’A’ of ‘N’ length containing all unique elements and an integer ‘k’.

Two pairs are good if both are adjacent to each other and the first value is smaller than the second value by at most ‘k’.

You can rearrange the array.

You have to find the maximum total number of good pairs in the given array by rearranging the array.

Example :
A  = [ ‘3’ , ‘5’ , ‘1’ , ‘2’ , ‘7’ ] , k = ’1’.
One of the optimal rearrangements is [ ‘7’, ‘1’, ‘2’, ‘3’, ‘5’ ]
The index (1, 2)(0-based) and (2, 3) are good pairs, so our answer is ‘2’. 

Cpp Solution:-

#include <bits/stdc++.h> 


int basicGame(int &n, int &k, vector<int> &a)
{


  // Write your code here


  sort(a.begin(), a.end());


    int ans = 0;


    for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (a[i] - a[i - 1] <= k)
          ans++;
    }
    return ans;


}
