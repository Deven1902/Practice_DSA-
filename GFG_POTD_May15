Problem:- Count Total Setbits 
You are given a number N. Find the total number of setbits in the numbers from 1 to N.  

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Problem is difficult due to the same expected time complexity, other wise the brute force approach to this is very easy as it is not difficult to coun the SetBits.

        // the digit 1 is known as set bit in the terms of the computer.

    /*  the above solution is based on the fact that for the ith least significant bit, answer will be  
            (N/2^i)*2^(i-1)+ X 
            
        need to decalre variable two coz in the 2nd last line of the function... when i wrote 2<<=1; it threw compilation error at me; 
        
        hence resolved that using the variable and cleared the sampel test case;
